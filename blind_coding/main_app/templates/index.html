				<h5>- There are five questions of varying difficulties and points associated with them. <br> Score associated are 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 points respectively.</h5>
				<h5>- For every question, the first time you submit the correct answer, you are awarded points corresponding to that question and the time penalty is 
					also calculated which takes into consideration the time taken until last successful solve together with the number of wrong attempts</h5>
				<h5>- Standings will be based on the points scored and in cases of clashes, time penalties are compared and one with lesser time penalty is better ranker</h5>
				<h5>- Every time you give a correct answer, the question is automatically changed and code editor is reset.</h5>
				<h5>- You have only two attempts throughout the event to see the code you have written. To see the code, press Show Code button near Run button.</h5>
				<h5>- Don't try to open up the console or changing the window/tab. You'll be logged out immediately</h5>
